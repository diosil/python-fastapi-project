# FAST API project
## Welcome to my first end-to-end API project

This is a project based on the Freecodecamp project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA

In this project I used the following tools/techniques:

- [X] FastAPI
- [X] Postgres
- [X] Postman
- [X] Uvicorn
- [X] Alembic
- [X] Heroku
- [X] Git, GitActions
- [X] Docker, Docker compose
- [X] Oauth2 security
- [X] Docker, Docker compose

*** Broadly speaking this were the steps I took to complete the project: ***
    1st steps on API creation
    FastAPI introduction
    Creation of API tests
    Using Postman
    Using uvicorn to launch a local session
    Creation of list to interact as if it was a “database” 
    Use of Postgres and relational databases
    Use of psycopg2 to establish connection to PG
    Using SQL to query databases
    Using Cursors to fetch data from db
    Use of SQLAlchemy
    Use of Sessions
    Change the code from cursors (psycopg2) to sqlalchemy
    ORM vs Pedantic models
    Use of Sessions
    Change the code from cursors (psycopg2) to sqlalchemy
    sqlalchemy
    Routers
    FastAPI documentation
    Logging module
    JWT authentication
    Security on endpoints
    Response models
    Relationships using SQLAlchemy
    Endpoint query parameter
    Environment variables
    Add dataschema changes - Alembic
    Database migration tools
    Deploy to Heroku
    Introducing Docker 
    Dockerizing the aplication
    Introducing CI/CD
    Building and deploy on Git/Github Actions

This project was proven to be a demanding endeavour that I was happy to conclude :)
